# We Love Movies

We love movies is a project completed under the guidance of Thinkful.
The purpose of this project was to fully implement the backend of an application. 
I was tasked with setting up a database and building out routes so that users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews.

## Built with:
* Javascript
* Express 
* Knex
* PostgreSQL 
* RESTful API design principles
